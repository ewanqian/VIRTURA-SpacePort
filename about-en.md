## Core Principles

1. **Virtual-Real Symbiosis Principle** - Treat digital space as real space
2. **Decentralization Principle** - Each space station is relatively independent, but incubates in the SpacePort
3. **Engineering Thinking Principle** - Systematic, reusable, iterable
4. **Long-termism Principle** - Build long-term industry barriers
5. **Minimalism Principle** - Grasp the main contradiction, don't be complicated
6. **Asset Precipitation Principle** - Create once, reuse in multiple scenarios
