# Knowledge Network

> 中文版本：[README.md](README.md)

With "Immersive Experience" as the core, we build a complete knowledge chain of "Enlightenment → Advanced Implementation → Operation & Maintenance → Sustainable Development"; taking undergraduate courses of world-class universities as the benchmark, we balance theoretical depth and practical implementation, focus on lowering the threshold of Unity operation, integrate lightweight operation skills and convenient plug-in usage, integrate Unity operation and topic selection guidance, create a growing, feedback-oriented and contributable knowledge network to help quickly master core capabilities, create the first Demo quickly, and support the development of subsequent workshops and project implementation.

### 01-discover - Discover Phase
For beginners, providing undergraduate-level core concepts, Unity basic operation, and topic selection basic guidance, focusing on breaking through the Unity operation threshold, and quickly completing the first simple Demo with the help of convenient plugins.

[Go to 01-discover →](01-discover/README-en.md)

### 02-build - Build Phase
Advanced after getting started, providing front-end/back-end development basics, Unity advanced operation, and topic selection deepening guidance, connecting to SceneForge, LiveForge and other tools to achieve Demo landing and project development.

[Go to 02-build →](02-build/README-en.md)

### 03-operate - Operate Phase
Operation after project landing, providing daily maintenance, user operation, and problem troubleshooting guides to ensure the stable operation of immersive experience projects.

## Core Features

### 1. Undergraduate-level Knowledge Depth
Referencing courses from world-class universities such as Aalto University, MIT Media Lab, and Tsinghua University to provide professional-level theoretical foundations.

### 2. Unity Lightweight Operation
Focus on recommending the [VR Interaction Framework](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066) plugin, completely lowering the Unity operation threshold. You can complete the first Demo with drag-and-drop + plugin assistance throughout the process.

**Compatibility Notes**:
- ✅ Meta Quest - Fully compatible
- ⚠️ Apple Vision Pro - Poor compatibility, not recommended for now

### 3. Topic Selection Guidance
From basic to advanced, providing topic directions suitable for quick implementation to avoid blind topic selection.

### 4. Bilingual Support
All core documents provide Chinese and English versions for seamless switching.
