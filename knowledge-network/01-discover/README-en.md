# Discover Phase

> 中文版本：[README.md](README.md)

With "Immersive Experience" as the core, we build a complete knowledge chain of "Enlightenment → Advanced Implementation → Operation & Maintenance → Sustainable Development"; taking undergraduate courses of world-class universities as the benchmark, we balance theoretical depth and practical implementation, focus on lowering the threshold of Unity operation, integrate lightweight operation skills and convenient plug-in usage, integrate Unity operation and topic selection guidance, create a growing, feedback-oriented and contributable knowledge network to help quickly master core capabilities, create the first Demo quickly, and support the development of subsequent workshops and project implementation.

## Discover Phase Overview

This phase is for beginners, providing undergraduate-level core concepts, Unity basic operation, and topic selection basic guidance, focusing on breaking through the Unity operation threshold, and quickly completing the first simple Demo with the help of convenient plugins, understanding the core logic and importance of immersive experience; supporting exercises and feedback templates to form a closed loop of "learning → practice → feedback → iteration", laying the foundation for entering the next phase (build) and workshop development.

## Learning Path

| Module | Topic | Estimated Time |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| 00-orientation | Preparatory Stage | 30 minutes |
| 01-foundations | Foundations (Vision+Audio+Haptic) | 2 hours |
| 02-spatial-experience | Spatial Experience and Device Research | 2 hours |
| 03-3d-workflow | 3D Content Workflow | 1.5 hours |
| 04-first-demo | Your First Demo | 2 hours |

## Key Point: Unity Lightweight Operation

Unity operation threshold is extremely low, no complex configuration required, you can complete the first Demo with drag-and-drop + plugin assistance throughout the process!

**Recommended Plugin**: [VR Interaction Framework](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066)

**Key Steps**:
1. Drag the player controller prefab from the plugin directly into the Hierarchy window
2. **No additional configuration required!**
3. Import your own scene models

**Compatibility Notes**:
- ✅ Meta Quest - Fully compatible
- ⚠️ Apple Vision Pro - Poor compatibility, not recommended for now
