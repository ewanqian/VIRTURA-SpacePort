## Core Terms

### Spatial Computing

**Definition**: A computing paradigm that integrates digital content with physical space, allowing users to naturally interact with digital content in 3D space.

**Core Features**:
- 3D spatial awareness
- Natural interaction (gestures, eye tracking, etc.)
- Virtual-real fusion

**Application Case**: Apple Vision Pro spatial interaction

---

### Immersive Experience

**Definition**: An experience form that creates a sense of presence through multiple sensory stimuli (vision, hearing, touch, etc.).

**Core Elements**:
- Vision
- Hearing
- Touch
- Interaction

---

### VR / AR / MR

#### VR (Virtual Reality)
**Definition**: Fully immersive digital environment, everything the user sees is virtual content.

#### AR (Augmented Reality)
**Definition**: Overlaying digital content on top of the real world.

#### MR (Mixed Reality)
**Definition**: Virtual-real fusion, digital content can interact with the real world.

---

### Spatial Perception

**Definition**: The user's cognitive and understanding ability of 3D space, including depth perception, spatial positioning, etc.

**Core Dimensions**:
- Vision
- Hearing
- Touch

---

### Interaction Logic

**Definition**: The rules and processes of user interaction with the system.

**Core Principles of Immersive Interaction**:
- Natural and intuitive
- Clear feedback
- Consistent with user habits

**Plugin Simplified Interaction**: Using Unity XR plugins allows quick configuration without complex left/right hand separate configuration.

---

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

**Definition**: A fast, low-cost prototype for validating core concepts and interaction processes.

**Design Key Points**:
- Quick production
- Focus on validating core logic
- No need for aesthetics

---

### 3D Workflow

**Definition**: The complete process from creation to application of 3D content.

**Core Stages**:
- Scanning
- Generation
- Optimization

**Unity Adaptation Key Points**: Focus on quick import of models and materials.

---

### Gaussian Splatting

**Definition**: A technology that converts images into 3D Gaussian scenes.

**Core Advantages**:
- Fast rendering
- Strong realism
- Suitable for real scene reconstruction

---

### Stereoscopic Vision

**Definition**: The ability to form depth perception through binocular parallax.

**Formation Principle**: The images seen by the left and right eyes are slightly different, and the brain generates a sense of depth through synthesis.

---

### Haptic Perception

**Definition**: Perceptual experience obtained through touch.

**Core Technologies**:
- Force feedback
- Vibration feedback
- Haptic texture

---

### Unity (Engine)

**Definition**: A cross-platform game engine widely used for immersive experience development.

**Core Functions**:
- 3D rendering
- Physics simulation
- Interaction system

**Basic Operation Key Points**:
- Simple drag-and-drop
- Plugin assistance
- Focus on quick Demo

---

### Topic Selection

**Definition**: The process of determining project themes and directions.

**Topic Selection Principles**:
- Fit your own practical ability
- Fit the core needs of immersive experience
- Implementable
- Can be quickly completed with Unity+plugin

---

### Unity XR Plugin (VR Interaction Framework)

**Definition**: A Unity plugin for quick VR interaction development.

**Plugin Link**: [https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066)

**Core Functions**:
- Quick configuration of character control
- Scene viewing
- No need to manually set camera, left/right hand interaction

**Compatible Devices**:
- ✅ Meta Quest - Fully compatible
- ⚠️ Apple Vision Pro - Poor compatibility

---

### Prefab

**Definition**: Reusable game object templates in Unity.

**Core Functions**:
- Quick reuse
- Unified modification
- Improve efficiency

**Unity XR Plugin Usage**: Directly drag the character controller prefab into the scene to simplify scene configuration.
